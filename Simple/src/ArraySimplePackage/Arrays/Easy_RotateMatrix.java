/*
Problem Description
You are given a n x n 2D matrix A representing an image.

Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You need to do this in place.

Note: If you end up using an additional array, you will only receive partial score.



Problem Constraints
1 <= n <= 1000

Solution approach
Since this is a N*N matrix
Transpose + each row reverse
For transpose
row => i in [0,R]
cols => j in [i+1,C]
