Sum n natual number= (N*(N+1))/2
Nth term of AP= A+(N-1)*D
Sum of N terms=N/2*(2A+(N-1)*D)
GP=a(R^N-1)/(R-1)



log2 2^N==N

GCD is actually D-->C-->G
    meaning get all *Devisors* , then look for *Common* , then pick the *Greatest*
    Range will lie between (min of both till 0)
    Practical usage : distribute N,M items equally it will get how many people will get equal share
LCM is actually M-->C-->L
    meaning get all *Multiples* , then look for *Common*, then pick *Least*
    Range will lie between (max of both till Infinite)
    Practical Usage : collect items
Since upper bound of LCM is higher

if LCM is asked we can calculate if using LCM=A*B/GCD
